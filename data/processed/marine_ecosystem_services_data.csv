"Nutrient Subsidies","Marine-derived nutrients (N, P, trace elements) enhance decomposition rates","Positive - Enhanced nutrient availability","Positive - Improved food quality","Protect coastal nutrient cycles from pollution"
"Detritivore Communities","Marine and coastal detritivores (isopods, amphipods, crabs) process organic matter","Indirect - Through fragmentation and grazing","Positive - Complementary decomposition","Conserve marine detritivore habitats"
"Microbial Inoculation","Marine microbial communities supplement terrestrial decomposition processes","Positive - Microbial diversity increase","Indirect - Via microbial food sources","Maintain water quality for microbial health"
"Microclimate Regulation","Ocean moderates temperature extremes, reducing environmental variability stress","Positive - Reduced environmental stress","Positive - Stable environmental conditions","Preserve coastal vegetation buffers"
"Organic Matter Input","Seaweed, marine debris, and beach wrack provide additional organic substrates","Mixed - New substrate types","Positive - Diverse food sources","Sustainable beach wrack management"
"Habitat Connectivity","Coastal habitats create corridors for decomposer organism movement and dispersal","Positive - Microbial dispersal","Positive - Habitat connectivity","Maintain ecological corridors"
"Moisture Regulation","Sea breezes and coastal humidity maintain optimal moisture for decomposition","Positive - Moisture optimization","Positive - Reduced desiccation risk","Protect coastal hydrological systems"
"Biodiversity Support","High coastal biodiversity supports diverse and resilient decomposer communities","Positive - Functional redundancy","Positive - Trophic support","Conserve coastal biodiversity hotspots"
