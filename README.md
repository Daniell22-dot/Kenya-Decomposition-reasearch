# Kenya Decomposition Research

## Project Overview
This research project investigates how microenvironmental variability differently predicts microorganism- and fauna-driven litter decomposition across Kenya, with special focus on coastal marine influences.

## Research Question
"How does environmental variability affect decomposition processes differently for microorganisms versus soil fauna in Kenyan ecosystems?"

## Key Findings
- Microorganisms show stronger sensitivity to environmental variability than soil fauna
- Coastal marine ecosystems provide critical services supporting decomposition
- Temperature variability has stronger negative effects on microbes than fauna
- Marine-terrestrial linkages significantly influence coastal decomposition patterns

## Project Structure

## Data Sources
- WorldClim bioclimatic variables
- Kenya county boundaries
- Field decomposition measurements (simulated)

## Methods
- Spatial analysis using R (sf, terra packages)
- Statistical correlation analysis
- GIS mapping and visualization
- Marine ecosystem services assessment

## Requirements
- R 4.0+
    - Key packages: sf, terra, tidyverse, ggplot2, officer

## Usage
See individual script files for specific analyses.
